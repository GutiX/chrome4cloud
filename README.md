cloud4chrome
============

Google Chrome extension that integrates some of the browser's accessibility features with the [Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII)](http://gpii.net/). 
The extension gets the needs and preferences of a user from the Cloud and adapts the accessibility capabilities of Google Chrome.

In this version, the user will be able to choose:

- Whether to activate or deactivate [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) 
- High contrast (invert filter)
- Zoom level (between 100 % and 300%)
- Font size (medium - large - x-large)
- Line height
- Font face
- Simplification (beta - for now, it just picks all text elements from the DOM and lists them one after another).

The settings of the user are now stored using Chrome's sync storage. In the future, the preferences will be downloaded from the preferences server of Cloud4all.

Installation
============

Download the [source code](https://github.com/GutiX/chrome4cloud/archive/master.zip) to a folder on your computer.
