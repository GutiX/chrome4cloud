cloud4chrome
============

Google Chrome extension that gets the needs and preferences of a user from the Cloud and adapts the accessibility capabilities of Google Chrome

In this first version, the user will be able to choose:

- Whether to activate or deactivate Chromevox
- High contrast (invert filter)
- Zoom level (100 %- 200% - 300%)
- Font size (medium - large - x-large)
- Simplification (beta - for now, it just picks all text elements from the DOM and lists them one after another).

The settings of the user are now stored using Chrome's sync storage. In a future, the preferences will be downloaded from the preferences server of Cloud4all.

Installation
============

Download the source code to a folder in your computer. 

In Google Chrome, click the 'Customise and control Google Chrome' icon in the upper right side of the screen, then click 'Settings'. In the left menu, click on 'Extensions'. Make sure that the 'developer mode' checkbox is on, and then click on 'Load unpacked extensions'. In the dialog box, select the folder where you downloaded cloud4chrome.
